    "# PCAI Use Case Demo - Supervised Fine-tuning\n",
    "## What is Supervised Fine-tuning?\n",
    "Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) involves training a pre-trained large language model on a labeled dataset with input-output pairs. The model learns to map inputs to the correct outputs by minimizing prediction errors. This process tailors the LLM to perform better on specific tasks or domains.\n",
    "Through supervised fine-tuning (SFT), we can achieve the following objectives:\n",
    "- SFT enables precise control over the model’s output format and style, ensuring consistency across responses.\n",
    "- In specialized domains, SFT helps tailor the model to meet specific requirements and adhere to domain-relevant standards."

Instead of updating all the model parameters, LoRA only updates these lightweight adapters, drastically reducing the number of trainable parameters and computational resources required. This makes fine-tuning much faster and more cost-effective.\n",

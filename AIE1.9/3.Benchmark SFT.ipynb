    "## What is Lighteval?\n",
    "Lighteval is your all-in-one toolkit for evaluating LLMs across multiple backends—whether it’s transformers, tgi, inference providers, vllm, or nanotron-with ease. Dive deep into your model’s performance by saving and exploring detailed, sample-by-sample results to debug and see how your models stack-up."
